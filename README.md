# Bash shell scripts

This is a folder where I keep some useful bash shell scripts.  If you want to use them, you can clone the repo.  If you have some you think I might find useful, send me a pull request.

If you're on UNIX you can clone it to your home directory and add it to your path with
```export PATH=${PATH}:~/scripts```
so that you can use them anywhere on your machine
